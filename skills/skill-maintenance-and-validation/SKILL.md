# Skill Maintenance And Validation

Use this skill to keep existing skills healthy after edits or to harden a newly created skill before relying on it.

This skill is for maintenance, consistency, and validation work on skills themselves. It is not the primary skill for creating a brand-new domain workflow from scratch; use `skill-creator` for that.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user:

- wants to update an existing skill and avoid drift
- wants to validate that a skill still matches its metadata and references
- wants to add or refine skills without breaking routing or handoff behavior
- wants a repeatable quality pass on a custom skill set
- hits a validator or environment problem and needs a reliable fallback validation workflow

## Core Workflow

1. Inspect the skill package first.
   - Read `SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, and any referenced files that matter for the change.
   - Confirm the skill directory shape is intentional and minimal.
   - Check whether the skill overlaps with or should hand off to another existing skill.

2. Check trigger quality.
   - Ensure frontmatter `name` and `description` clearly say when the skill should be used.
   - Ensure the description is specific enough to trigger for the intended tasks without swallowing unrelated work.
   - Check that the body instructions are consistent with the trigger promise.

3. Check internal consistency.
   - `agents/openai.yaml` should match the actual skill purpose.
   - `default_prompt` should mention the skill as `$skill-name`.
   - Referenced files in `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` should exist and still fit the workflow.
   - Handoffs to other skills should be intentional, not accidental duplication.

4. Validate progressively.
   - Run the bundled validator if the local environment supports it.
   - If the validator is blocked by missing dependencies or environment gaps, perform a manual fallback pass:
     - check frontmatter shape
     - check hyphen-case name
     - check description clarity
     - check referenced files exist
     - check `openai.yaml` consistency
     - check for stale or contradictory instructions

5. Keep the skill lean.
   - Prefer a concise `SKILL.md` plus targeted references over one bloated instruction file.
   - Move detailed material into `references/` only when it is truly reusable and only loadable on demand.
   - Avoid adding extra docs such as README or changelog files.

6. Close with honest validation status.
   - Say whether validation was tool-based or fallback/manual.
   - Call out remaining risks such as missing local dependencies, stale references, or overlap with another skill.
   - Do not claim a skill is fully validated if the validator could not run and fallback checks found unresolved issues.

## Required Outputs

For non-trivial skill maintenance work, produce or update:

- the skill files themselves
- any necessary references under `references/`
- `agents/openai.yaml` when the UI-facing metadata is stale
- a concise closeout note that distinguishes:
  - validator passed
  - fallback/manual validation only
  - known remaining maintenance gaps

## Decision Defaults

Use these defaults unless the user overrides them:

- update existing skills instead of creating duplicates when the scope clearly belongs in one place
- prefer one primary owner skill plus explicit handoffs over overlapping mega-skills
- keep `SKILL.md` procedural and concise
- keep detailed examples or checklists in references
- run validator-based checks when possible
- if validator dependencies are missing, do a documented fallback validation instead of pretending validation succeeded

## References

Read these only as needed:

- `references/validation-checklist.md`
  Use for the standard maintenance and validation checklist.
- `references/fallback-validation.md`
  Use when the bundled validator cannot run cleanly.
- `references/scope-and-overlap.md`
  Use when deciding whether to update, split, or hand off between skills.
